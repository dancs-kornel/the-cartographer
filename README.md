# The Cartographer
## Game overview
### Short summary

The Cartographer is a single-player game that challenges players to strategically place various-shaped map elements of different terrain types onto an 11x11 grid map. The game unfolds over four seasons, each comprising seven time units, with a total of 28 time units. Your objective is to complete missions during the game, and your final score is determined based on your performance.

### Placing Map elements
The game features diverse terrain types, including forests, villages, farms, and water. Map elements of these terrains are shuffled randomly, requiring players to strategically place them one by one on the map. Each map element is rotatable and mirrorable, with the restriction that it cannot cover an already filled cell. Additionally, no part of the map element can extend beyond the grid boundaries.

### Game duration
The game unfolds over four seasons, with each season comprising seven time units, totaling 28 time units. Each map element has an associated time unit, indicating the time required to discover it. Players can draw new map elements until they reach the 28 time units limit. If the total time value equals or exceeds 28 time units, the game ends.

### Scoring
At the beginning of each game, four random mission cards (A, B, C, D) are selected to determine the points players can earn. Two missions are active at any given time, marked by a green circle, and are based on the current season. At the end of each season, the points for the active missions are evaluated and added to the player's total score.
